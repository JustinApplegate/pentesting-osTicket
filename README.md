# Pentesting osTicket
Introduction

## Discovery/Enumeration
### Version Number
To determine the version of osTicket in use, try visiting `BASE_URL/setup/` (like `http://doma.in/setup/`) to determine server version. This directory is only meant for the installation, and after being setup, a message is displayed in the admin dashboard advising the admins to delete this directory. If the directory is deleted, then the server version number isn't easily available - but can still be determined! Publicly-available files like CSS and JS files are often changed between versions, so the versions of the CSS and JS dependencies that are available on the site can give insight into the version of the application. 

This whole process is automated in `ostVersionScanner.py`. It will first check to see if the `/setup/` directory is available and report the version number contained there. If the directory was deleted, it will go through a set up checks to determine the exact version number or range of possible versions. It will determine version numbers unless the application is < 1.11, in which case it will just say `Version(s): < 1.11`.

### User/Email Discovery
- Username discovery in versions < 1.14.8, 1.15.x < 1.15.4 (see [here](commit-vulnerabilities/86165c/))

Usernames only exist for agents? Emails exist for both. Can brute force enumerate emails by attempting to sign up with an email, but if the email doesn't exist previously an account will be created (spike in users signed up).

### Ticket Discovery
- Access to tickets can be granted without a password if the email and ticket number is known (6-digit number). Then, an "authorized URL" is sent to that email address (not one of your choosing), but this link (if sniffed or stolen) can be used for all eternity, it never expires. You can verify ticket numbers with email addresses by brute force. Assuming a valid email address and 10 req/sec, it would take about 27 hours to try all possible ticket numbers.

## Common Misconfigurations
- Invalid logins are not piped to external logs by default, plugins must be used (https://github.com/osTicket/osTicket/issues/5716)
- Session cookies are set to HTTPonly in versions < 1.10.2 (https://github.com/osTicket/osTicket/commit/5b2dfce98ac05a68543b7603f3d46afafc09086d)
- Other juicy details from /setup/ directory being available?

## Privilege Escalation
User -> Agent -> Admin -> compromise server

Also how to move vertically (get access to other accounts or tickets, which can give away sensitive information)

## Notes
- UserAgent must be the same for all HTTP requests with the same session, or else the session will die (versions < 1.14.7, 1.15.x < 1.15.3) https://github.com/osTicket/osTicket/commit/f71c95482cc12c2a0e6360e916b1bd5495b12738
- Look into plugins
